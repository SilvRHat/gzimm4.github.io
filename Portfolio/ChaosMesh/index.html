			<h4> Noir Verscottie</h4>
			<p style="margin: 14px">
				Noir is a character I developed for an art course earlier this year. Since then I've been expanding on the character in her own video game. I want this project to showcase crazy visual components and movement systems which truly give the player a sense of the agility and oddities of being a ghost. And chaotic dynamics came as a perfect tool for achieving that.

		<h3>About the Project</h3>
		<p style="margin: 14px">
			As part of Chaotic Dynamics, I took on a project to formally define a method and tool of utilizing chaotic attractors for movement and aesthetic systems in games and animations. These methods of chaotic variations are intended for constrained physical systems to behave in a continuous and disorderly way.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Goals / Motivations</h3>
		<p style="margin: 14px">
			<ul>
				<li>Achieve a dynamic, fluid, and natural procedural animation through embedding chaos into the system's movement.</li>
				<li>Utilize the deterministic behaviour to reduce memory requirements for recreating same movement patterns. </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Feedback Survey</h3>
		<p style="margin: 14px">
			The following surveys showcase the utilization of chaotic systems for creating a unique character animation.

				<!--<li><a href="">General Aesthetic Survey</a> (For anyone)</li>-->
