				<h3>Environment</h3>
				<br>
				<p class="reg_desc">
					All source code is written in Lua on Robloxâ€™s Platform. <br>
					Scripts are placed in a world hierarchy tree which is used to build the game enivornment. They may be be run either on client or server with differing permissions. Programmed completely in the context of Roblox classes and corresponding <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference">API</a> methods.

				<h3>Structure</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_desc">
					Provided are descriptions on scripts which directly guide gameplay. <br>
					Client-sided scripts typically monitor user input, provide immediate feedback, and signal server to validate and carry out those actions.<br>
					Server-sided scripts are take on various roles and communicate data through signaled functions.
				</p>
				<div class="code_block">
					Main [SERVER]<br><br>
					Operates gameplay cycle and game state. Cycles through setup, intermission, game round, round results and rewards.<br>
					Also manages endpoints to other server scripts to handle purchasable content which affects round setup (Ex. Choose Recipe Product).
					<br><br><br>
					 
					Store [SERVER]<br><br>
					Handles player data and product purchases. Enables player data to persist across game sessions. Enables a daily bonus rewarding extra points for consecutive days a player visits game. Manages upgrade purchases and purchasable content, verifying purchase are valid and fulfilled.<br>
					<br><br><br>
					
					Recipe Module [MOD - SERVER]<br><br>
					Operates gameplay systems adjusted towards a specific recipe. Verifies and performs interactions, manipulating 3D environment in process. Communicates with Main, tracking most current scores and submission entries.<br>
					<br><br><br>
					
					Recipe Module [MOD - CLIENT]<br><br>
					Operates gameplay systems adjusted towards a specific recipe. Prompts player when interactions can be made. Sends signal to server on input 'E'. Some interactions require a key be pressed, where progress is displayed to user and communicated with server on early cancels.<br>
					<br><br><br>
					
					
					Appearance [SERVER]<br><br>
					Manages minor details in game appearance. Customizes characters in a chef avatar, designating premium players with red chat text and red clothing. <br>
					<br><br><br>
					
					UI_main [CLIENT]<br><br>
					Implements entire user interface. Communicates game state with player, round details, and round results. Allows user to interact with a shop, a tutorial, and current selected recipe.<br>
