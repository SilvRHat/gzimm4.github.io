				<h4>JUL 2020 - CURRENT<br>
				Lua | python</h4>
				<h3>Setting</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					Times are troubling in this steampunk-esc era where tech advances simply canâ€™t keep up with resource supply. This has brought about the new trade of a scraper bounty hunter, those who master in salvaging highly-prized materials. These scrapers operate in 3 person teams and are masters social engineering. However, their goal is highly competitive and often requires trickery on other teams. Play with your friends as a scraper team, search the map for clues, and uncover valuable artifacts before anyone else.

				<h3>Why</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					Game design is how I kick back and enjoy the moment. I brew coffee, queue up whatever music I'm into that week, and go at it for hours. This project I'm especially passionate about and have been thinking of for over a year. <br>
					<br>
					I've taken this on as a solo project and am directly working on every aspect of the game from level design to UI/ UX to programming. However, I'm using this as an opportunity to connect with various developers skilled in various disciplines and better learn their processes.

				<h3>Seamap</h3><br>
				<p class='reg_text'>
					Here I've broken up various development goals over the span of a few months. <br>
					Many of which are closed beta, meaning they have been developed and prototyped, but do not have an environment yet to be implemented. These are more of tools for later goals.
