				<h3>Setting</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					Times are troubling in this steampunk-esc era where tech advances simply canâ€™t keep up with resource supply. This has brought about the new trade of a scraper bounty hunter, those who master in salvaging highly-prized materials. These scrapers operate in 3 person teams and are masters social engineering. However, their goal is highly competitive and often requires trickery on other teams. Play with your friends as a scraper team, search the map for clues, and uncover valuable artifacts before anyone else.

				<h3>Development</h3><br>
				<div class="reg_text">
					Developer: SilvrShip Studios<br>
					<br>
					Additional Thanks:
					<ul>
						<li>Jan Stec - Lead Game Designer at Toys for Bob; consulted for input on character verbs and maintaining fairness in multiplayer setting.</li>
						<li>Eric Wustrow - Professor at CU; consulted for help on HMAC model for verifying server integrity.</li>

				<h3>Why</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					I've taken this on as a solo project and am directly working on every aspect of the game from level design to UI/ UX to programming. I'm using this as an opportunity to connect with various developers skilled in various disciplines and better learn their processes. Its a project I'm really excited about and have been thinking of for over a year.

				<h3>Seamap</h3><br>
				<p class='reg_text'>
					Here I've broken up various development goals over the span of a few months. <br>
					Some of which are closed beta, meaning they have been developed and prototyped, but yet to have an environment to be integrated in. These act as tools and abstractions for to-be-written systems.
