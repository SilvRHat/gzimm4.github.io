				<h3>Synopsis</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					I've composed this 'code reel' to demonstrate myself as a professional programmer. I value open-sourcing, so naturally the work mentioned here is available for reviewing, using, and modifying for free. All work here, unless explicitly stated, is completely authored and designed by myself. Feel free to get in touch, I'm happy to recieve any input/ comments and answer any questions.<br><br>
					RECRUITERS: Please also feel free to reach out if you'd like additional code samples to review myself as an applicant.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="topic">
				<h3>Selection</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					All projects shown here fall within the last half year. The majority are un-related to school or work; and instead showcase my personal interests. <br><br>
					The 'active' section is composed of projects which I may have a few or no code samples on. These will showcase my design process and an allocated timeline. And I'd be happy to talk about these projects as I'm really excited about them.
				</p>

					This week I plan on adding:<br>
