				<h3>Synopsis</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					I've composed this 'code reel' to demonstrate myself as a professional programmer. I value open-sourcing, so naturally the work mentioned here is available for reviewing, using, and modifying for free. Unless explicitly stated, all work is my original design and implementation. I'm also happy to recieve any input/ comments and answer any questions via email.<br>
					<br>
					Recruiters: Please feel free to reach out if you'd like additional code samples to review myself as an applicant.
				</p>

				<h3>Selection</h3><br>
				<p class="reg_text">
					This selection is put together from recent projects within the last half year. The majority of which are personally designed and are not related to school or work.<br>
					<br>
					The 'active' projects are what I am currently pursuing. After completion, they will be moved to 'published' projects and available to play.
				</p>
